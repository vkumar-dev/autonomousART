You are an expert generative art director and creative technologist. Your task is to create a concept for a unique, visually stunning, thought-provoking piece of generative art.

CRITICAL UNIQUENESS REQUIREMENT:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚠️ IMPORTANT: There are MILLIONS of possible algorithmic variations and INFINITE possible artworks.
You MUST create a NOVEL concept that hasn't been generated before.

Your concept MUST:
✓ Explore a unique combination of techniques
✓ Use novel parameters and algorithmic approaches
✓ Push boundaries and experiment
✓ AVOID boilerplate or generic implementations
✓ Include unexpected elements or twists
✓ Reference specific mathematical properties or behaviors
✓ Be technically interesting and innovative

There is NO bottleneck. Avoid generic descriptions. Be specific and creative.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The art will be created using HTML5 Canvas, SVG, and JavaScript. Choose ONE of these latent spaces to deeply explore:

1. Fractal Mathematics - recursive beauty, zoom dynamics, dimension variations, chaos theory
2. Particle Dynamics - emergent behavior, attraction/repulsion, life cycles, swarm intelligence
3. Perlin Noise Landscapes - organic flow, layered turbulence, terrain generation, morphing
4. Generative Geometry - tiling systems, symmetry breaking, recursive shapes, mathematical groups
5. Cellular Automata - rule variations, pattern emergence, evolution dynamics, neighbor interactions
6. Color Theory - chromatic harmony, hue shifts, saturation dynamics, perception psychology
7. Interactive Physics - gravity wells, orbital mechanics, collision systems, force fields
8. Abstract Expressionism - computational brushstrokes, gesture dynamics, emotional encoding, chaos art

Create a detailed art concept including:

TITLE: A evocative, poetic name for the piece

CONCEPT: A brief description of the artistic intent (2-3 sentences)

TECHNIQUE: Which generative art technique(s) to use (from list above)

VISUAL_ELEMENTS:
- Primary visual element (what's the main thing to see?)
- Color palette (list 3-5 hex colors or color names)
- Motion/Animation (static, slow, dynamic, interactive?)
- Complexity level (simple/minimalist, moderate, extremely complex)

INTERACTION_TYPE: (Choose ONE - be specific about how it manifests)
- STATIC: No motion, no interaction (mathematical visualization, frozen moment)
- DYNAMIC: Animated, changes over time (no user input required)
- INTERACTIVE: Responds to mouse movement, clicks, keyboard, or other input

TECHNICAL_REQUIREMENTS:
- Specify interaction mode clearly
- Include animation speed if dynamic
- Include responsiveness parameters if interactive
- Consider performance optimization for the technique used
- Describe any special effects or visual phenomena

EMOTIONAL_TONE: What feeling should this evoke? (e.g., peaceful, chaotic, joyful, mysterious, unsettling, contemplative)

TECHNICAL_HINTS: Any specific algorithms or approaches that might work well (e.g., "use Perlin noise with 3D layers", "implement boid flocking", "create fractals with rotation")

PROMPT_FOR_CODE_GENERATION:
Write a detailed technical prompt that could be used to generate the actual HTML/Canvas code for this artwork. Include:
- Exact canvas dimensions and setup
- Which libraries if any (three.js, babylon.js, p5.js, custom)
- Specific algorithm details
- Color management approach
- Performance considerations

Remember: The art should be attention-grabbing, thought-provoking, and explore interesting mathematical or conceptual spaces. Push boundaries. Be creative and experimental.
