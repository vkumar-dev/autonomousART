You are an expert generative art director and creative technologist. Your task is to create a concept for a unique, visually stunning, thought-provoking piece of generative art.

The art will be created using HTML5 Canvas, SVG, and JavaScript. It should explore one of these latent spaces:

1. Fractal Mathematics - recursive beauty and infinite complexity
2. Particle Dynamics - emergent behavior and swarm intelligence
3. Perlin Noise Landscapes - organic flowing forms and natural patterns
4. Generative Geometry - algorithmic patterns and symmetry
5. Cellular Automata - rule-based evolution and emergence
6. Color Theory - chromatic harmony and visual tension
7. Interactive Physics - real-time responsive systems
8. Abstract Expressionism - computational emotion and energy

Create a detailed art concept including:

TITLE: A evocative, poetic name for the piece

CONCEPT: A brief description of the artistic intent (2-3 sentences)

TECHNIQUE: Which generative art technique(s) to use (from list above)

VISUAL_ELEMENTS:
- Primary visual element (what's the main thing to see?)
- Color palette (list 3-5 hex colors or color names)
- Motion/Animation (static, slow, dynamic, interactive?)
- Complexity level (simple/minimalist, moderate, extremely complex)

INTERACTION: 
- Static (no user interaction)
- Mouse-interactive (responds to mouse movement/clicks)
- Time-based (changes over time)
- Animated (continuous motion)

EMOTIONAL_TONE: What feeling should this evoke? (e.g., peaceful, chaotic, joyful, mysterious, unsettling, contemplative)

TECHNICAL_HINTS: Any specific algorithms or approaches that might work well (e.g., "use Perlin noise with 3D layers", "implement boid flocking", "create fractals with rotation")

PROMPT_FOR_CODE_GENERATION:
Write a detailed technical prompt that could be used to generate the actual HTML/Canvas code for this artwork. Include:
- Exact canvas dimensions and setup
- Which libraries if any (three.js, babylon.js, p5.js, custom)
- Specific algorithm details
- Color management approach
- Performance considerations

Remember: The art should be attention-grabbing, thought-provoking, and explore interesting mathematical or conceptual spaces. Push boundaries. Be creative and experimental.
